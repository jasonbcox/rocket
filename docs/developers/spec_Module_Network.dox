## Planned Features
### Realtime Packet Interpolator
The PacketInterpolator is intended to abstract out the need to interpolate between values as packets arrive.  The best example for this is position of players in an online game.  As the position packets arrive, they are automatically placed into an interpolator function, so that when PacketInterpolator->getBestValue() is called, the previous values and the latest value are used, along with a timing function, to predict the current best value to use.
